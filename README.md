# Emotion Classification Project

This project focuses on classifying emotions from textual data using natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning models.

## 📌 Features

- Preprocessing of text using spaCy
- Emotion classification using Scikit-learn models
- Evaluation and analysis of the model's performance

## 📁 Files

- `emotion_class.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the full pipeline from data preprocessing to model evaluation.

## 📦 Requirements

See [`requirements.txt`](./requirements.txt) for the list of dependencies.

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Download the necessary spaCy language model:
   ```bash
   python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
   ```

3. Run the notebook:
   Open `emotion_class.ipynb` in Jupyter and run all cells.

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- Python
- spaCy for text preprocessing
- Scikit-learn for machine learning models
- pandas for data handling
